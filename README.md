# AdityaAnimeRecommendation

Anime is a hand-drawn computer animation originating from Japan which has drawn a cult following around the world. The animation industry consists
of more than 430 companies. Fans of anime often seek out other series within the same genre after falling in love with a particular show. This has
been implemented in this project. By typing into a search box or selecting from a drop-down menu, the user can choose a specific anime. Our
recommendation system will then propose five other anime series that share similarities with the user's selection. While working on this project, I
acquired skills in web scraping, data preprocessing, deploying a Streamlit app and NLP. Through this project, I was able to polish my Python
programming skills.
